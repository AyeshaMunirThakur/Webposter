      <h3>The International Lecture Series: Beyond Bias.</h3>
      <p>
        This international lecture series brings together academics and researchers from
        around the world to share their experiences, methodologies, and scholarly approaches
        to fostering inclusive collaborations across borders. Focusing on the intersection 
        of global education and creative research, the series aims to provide valuable insights 
        on how to collaborate effectively with students and professors from diverse cultural 
        backgrounds.
        <br /><br />
        Each lecture will feature expert speakers who will share their personal journeys,
        research strategies, and academic examples of successful international collaborations.
        Emphasizing cultural awareness, the series will explore how to navigate biases, promote
        equity, equality, and social justice, and go beyond preconceptions to build a more
        inclusive and respectful global creative community. This series invites participants
        to reflect on their own cultural assumptions and gain tools to engage with international
        colleagues and students in a meaningful, ethical, and thoughtful way. By challenging
        misconceptions and fostering mutual understanding, we aim to create collaborations that
        are both globally relevant and locally responsive.
        <br /><br />
        Join us in this inspiring series that aims to not only expand creative boundaries but
        also nurture a culture of inclusivity and justice in global academic and creative
        research. To join these upcoming lectures, sign up using the online form on our website.

    <h5>Speaker's Biography</h5>
    <p>
      Dr. Isabel Machado is a Brazilian cultural historian whose work often crosses 
      national and disciplinary boundaries. She specializes in the fields of Gender and Sexuality 
      Studies and Celebration Studies. Her first book, Carnival in Alabama: Marked Bodies and 
      Invented Traditions in Mobile (2023), uses Mardi Gras as a vehicle to understand social 
      and cultural changes in Mobile, Alabama in the second half of the 20th century. For the 
      ongoing oral history project, Queens of the South(s), she is interviewing performers who 
      defy gender normativity in different parts of the globe. She serves as co-editor-in-chief 
      for the Journal of Festival Studies and as a host for the New Books Network Podcast and 
      is currently a Lecturer at the University of British Columbia’s Institute for Gender, 
      Race, Sexuality and Social Justice.

      Lecture Date: Wednesday, Feb 5th at 1:00 pm EST<br />
      Lecture: Fostering Inclusive Communities in the Classroom through Project-Driven Courses.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Isabel Machado will discuss the challenges and positive results of building inclusive
      classroom communities through public-facing collaborative projects by applying her 
      research methodology to her course design. “Co-documenting” is the process of 
      establishing partnerships and collaborations so that the research is relevant and 
      accessible to the people involved. It is also an attempt to dismantle epistemic 
      hierarchies and the separation between research and academic “communities.” An 
      important element of this process is thinking about how different people can produce 
      and share knowledges together, even when they come from diverse backgrounds and are 
      dealing with delicate subjects. Building a project together fosters collaboration and 
      helps the students realize that everyone can make valuable contributions to our 
      learning community(ies) while making theory more tangible, translatable, and shareable. 
      Yet, this is not always a smooth experience as it also involves finding together ways 
      to deal with fears and discomfort.

      Lecture: Branches: Weaving Stories in Design and education
    </h4>
    <p>
      This presentation is a collaboration between Daniel Wildberger and Erik Páez, sparked 
      by a central question: How might a former student and teacher co-design a talk that 
      weaves their histories in design and education together? To visualize their intertwined 
      journeys, Daniel and Erik investigate the shifting dynamics of teacher-student 
      collaborations, exploring these narratives through multiple lenses: over time, across 
      different spaces, and through evolving roles. Through the creation of this metapresentation,
       they aim to foster a space for mutual reflection, where their individual contributions 
       coalesce into the fabric of a collective knowledge.

      Lecture: Being There: A Virtual Reality Museum of Migrant Women
    </h4>
    <p>
      This presentation introduces Being There, a virtual reality museum that highlights 
      the stories of migrant women from Latin America, created through a COIL project. 
      Students from BUas (The Netherlands) and UDEM (Mexico) worked together in a 
      multidisciplinary effort to design an immersive VR experience, partnering with the 
      Lamentos Escuchados Migration Center in Monterrey, Mexico. The project brings to life 
      the personal journeys of migrant women as they travel through Mexico toward the 
      United States, focusing on their challenges, aspirations, and their concept of “home.” 
      By digitally portraying a mother and child, the VR museum aims to foster empathy and 
      raise awareness about the realities migrant women face. The presentation will explore 
      the international collaboration, creative process, challenges encountered, and the 
      project’s broader goal of building understanding and empathy for migrant women.
